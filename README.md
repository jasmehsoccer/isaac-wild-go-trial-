# Isaac-PhyRL-Go2

This project implements

## To Do ##
* [x] Add BEV map to the repo
* [x] Fast Marching Method (FMM) implementation
* [ ] Incorporate more challenging scenarios
  * [ ] Dense forests (sandy terrain, trees)
  * [ ] inclined staircases, and rainy conditions
* [ ] Go2 real robot deployment
  * [ ] Gazebo real-time testing
  * [ ] ROS/ROS2 encapsulation
* [ ] Restructure the code as FSM and add teleoperation (optional)
* [ ] Migration to Isaac-Lab

## User Guide

### Dependencies
